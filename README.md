# Points table

Class with implemented solution:
```pl.proccorp.eqpoints.MatchTable```

If you want to see how it looks like run:
```pl.proccorp.eqpoints.view.DummyScoreViewer.main```
and go to: http://localhost:8181/points/

Or just visit deployed version:
http://eventory.proccorp.pl:8181/points/ 

App is written in TDD approach. See commits history.

Solution is not ready:
- last set should end in another way.
- tests need general refactor (moving some tests to unit tests, add more unit tests, test code cleanup)
